# work_time
This code does the following:

1. Uses `Scanner` to read the start and end times of work from the user.
2. Converts the entered strings into `LocalTime`.
3. Calculates the difference in hours between the start and end times of work using `ChronoUnit.HOURS.between`.
4. Outputs the number of hours worked.
5. To run this program, you will need to copy the code into a file with a `.java` extension (for example, `WorkHoursCalculator.java`), compile it using the Java compiler, and then run the compiled class.
